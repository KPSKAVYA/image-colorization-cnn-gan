# 🎨 Image Colorization of Grayscale Images using ConvNets and GANs

This project focuses on colorizing grayscale images using a combination of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** with image processing enhancements in the LAB color space.

---

## 🧠 Overview
- Converts grayscale images to color using LAB color space.
- Trains CNN and GAN models for color prediction.
- Evaluates performance using **PSNR** and **SSIM**.
- Includes a **Gradio app** for interactive colorization.
